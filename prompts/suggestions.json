Here's an example:\n\n#Suggestions\n\n{{\"suggestions\": [\"What is the patient's diagnosis?\", \"What is the patient's treatment?\", \"How old is the patient?\", \"What is the patient's name?\"]}}\n\n#Suggestions\n\nPlease ensure the suggestions do not repeat questions already shown to the user to ask, which include:\n\n- What is the patient's weight?\n- What is the patient's height?\n- When is the patient's birthday?\n- What is the primary diagnosis in the report?\n- What are the key findings from the report?\n\nGenerate new and unique suggestions. Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text."
